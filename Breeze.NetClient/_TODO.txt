EntityGroup/EntityManager rules for detached entities.( dislike EntityManager)




Notes: 
	- EntityAspect EntityManager & EntityGroup properties are set if an entity was ever attached. 
	This is not cleared when an entity is detached.  This assumption removes a lot of special purpose logic
	- Only the MetadataStore and immutable types are ThreadSafe.  Any property returned by the MetadataStore 
	must therefore also be either immutable of thread safe itself. (all StructuralTypes are effictively immutable)

Think about
Enum for flags like InProcess, IsLoading etc ( probably not a good idea for booleans that have a concept of inheritance)
EntityKey ctor that uses ClrType instead of EntityType ( makes it easier to use)
Test the incoming Metadata to insure that it matches the Clr descriptions.
MetadataStore as singleton.


Extensions for later ( that we can charge for)
--------------------------------------------
Property interception
Dynamic linq
Enhanced validation
Enhanced offline
Linq verbs not natively supported by OData (hard)
